The **abstract** of this presentation is:

> *Solara lets you build pure Python web apps. These apps work both inside the Jupyter Notebook and as standalone web apps. With Solara, you benefit from a paradigm that promotes component-based code and simplifies state management, making the development process more efficient and the applications more maintainable. Solara offers the flexibility to build complex apps, but keeps the simplicity of a small code base. We will compare Solara to Streamlit/Gradio and show their benefits and disadvantages.\
> AnyWidget is a Python library that simplifies creating and publishing custom Jupyter Widgets. No messy build configuration or complicated cookiecutter templates. It is not a new interactive widgets framework, but rather an abstraction for creating custom Jupyter Widgets using modern web standards.\
> Finally, we will see how Solara and AnyWidget synergize to create pure Python apps, demonstrating the complementary nature of these two powerful tools.*
